            <p>When I was around 5 years old, my Dad began taking me to the Burnaby Masjid also known as <a href="https://org.thebcma.com/burnaby" target="_blank">Masjid Al-Salaam</a> where he had taught me how to help out the community by assisting and multitasking in the kitchen during Ramadan and supporting the elderly by washing dishes, setting up tables, cleaning, and serving food to 200+ people for 10+ years.</p>

            <p>In September 2014, I took a course at <a href="https://www.bcsoccer.net/" target="_blank">BC Soccer</a> and started refereeing small-sided soccer matches. Once I turned 16, I started refereeing soccer matches in the <a href="https://vmslsoccer.com/" target="_blank">Vancouver Metro Soccer League</a>, <a href="https://ultrasoccerleague.com/" target="_blank">Ultra Soccer League</a>, <a href="https://www.pacwestbc.ca/landing/index" target="_blank">Pacific Western Athletic Assocation</a>, and more. Along with that experience, I also officiated games for some universities and tournaments for the <a href="https://www.whitecapsfc.com/" target="_blank">Whitecaps FC</a>. During that time, I met over 20+ experienced soccer officials developing strong team building, learning different techniques and skills, while developing good management and people skills.</p>

            <summary>Electrician - Work Experience</summary>
            <p>In September 2020, I started working as an Electrician at <a href="https://protecgroup.com/" target="_blank">Protec Installations Group</a>. Collaborating with a team of 10+ electricians to wire 8 rooms a day, we powered a commercial building by running armored cable on 20+ floors to supply wiring to switches, outlets, lights and electrical panels. During that time, I assisted 2 new electricians to get comfortable and familiar with the Protec workflow, while fixing electrical issues on lower levels in case wires malfunctioned or were misplaced. I was also asked to bring product, equipment, tools by our boss Brian Leopky up to the working electricians to improve work efficiency. In January of 2021, I decided I wanted to pursue a different career as I felt that this was not something I wanted to do for the rest of my life.</p>

            <p>After building my own Personal Computer in October 2020, I decided to look into what Programming/IT was all about so I decided to attend the <a href="https://www.bcit.ca/" target="_blank">Computer Information Technology</a> Program in September 2021 to learn everything there is to know about different computing technologies. Learning how to code, deploy applications, user interface, security, and much more. Finishing this program, I graduated with a 83% GPA in December 2023.</p>

            <p>After I got accepted into the Co-op Program before my 3rd Term in the Computer Information Technology Program. I went on a job search with the help of Susanna Kan, my Co-op Advisor. In October 2022, I received an internship offer from <a href="https://prospero.com/" target="_blank">CAMS Software</a> and started working as a Junior Developer in January 2023 for 8 months. During my time there, I learned how to code in a different language (C#), improved my knowledge in what I already knew (SQL) and demonstrated collaboration closely with 8 others in the team I was working with while diving into complex problems with effective solutions. Along what I was learning, I had created 10 manuals of documentation for any new developers that wanted to learn how to work with the legacy systems, and created a new tool with the new knowledge I obtained for over 15 clients. I also was able to solve over 40 tickets in time for continuous updates to the legacy system and learned how to communicate with 5 clients regarding any issues they had.</p>

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi there! I'm Zaafir Ali, but everyone calls me Zaaf. I was born and raised in New Westminster, British Columbia, and soccer has been a significant part of my life since I was 4, coached by my Dad. Besides soccer, I enjoy playing basketball, badminton, volleyball, and video games like Call of Duty, FIFA, and Minecraft.</p>

        <p>My upbringing was deeply influenced by my parents who enrolled me in classes at a local Masjid to learn about Islam, something I now deeply appreciate. Helping the elderly during Ramadan became a cherished activity.</p>

        <p>At 13, I became a soccer referee, which helped improve my communication and teamwork skills. I continued playing soccer competitively until I was 21.</p>

        <p>Post high school, I explored the construction industry but soon realized it wasn't for me. In 2020, I built my own gaming PC and discovered a passion for programming. This led me to enroll in a Computer Information Technology program at BCIT.</p>

        <p>Despite initial struggles, I persevered and landed a Junior Developer internship at CAMS Software, where I gained valuable experience in C# and software development.</p>

        <p>In June 2023, I started dating Natasha, my best friend, who later converted to Islam, and we got islamically married in January 2024. I moved to Kelowna to start a new chapter with her. Now, I'm actively seeking a developer/engineer position in the tech industry while working on personal projects.</p>

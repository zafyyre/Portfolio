            <p>In September 2014, I took a course at <a href="https://www.bcsoccer.net/" target="_blank">BC Soccer</a> and started refereeing small-sided soccer matches. Once I turned 16, I started refereeing soccer matches in the <a href="https://vmslsoccer.com/" target="_blank">Vancouver Metro Soccer League</a>, <a href="https://ultrasoccerleague.com/" target="_blank">Ultra Soccer League</a>, <a href="https://www.pacwestbc.ca/landing/index" target="_blank">Pacific Western Athletic Assocation</a>, and more. Along with that experience, I also officiated games for some universities and tournaments for the <a href="https://www.whitecapsfc.com/" target="_blank">Whitecaps FC</a>. During that time, I met over 20+ experienced soccer officials developing strong team building, learning different techniques and skills, while developing good management and people skills.</p>

            <p>In September 2020, I started working as an Electrician at <a href="https://protecgroup.com/" target="_blank">Protec Installations Group</a>. Collaborating with a team of 10+ electricians to wire 8 rooms a day, we powered a commercial building by running armored cable on 20+ floors to supply wiring to switches, outlets, lights and electrical panels. During that time, I assisted 2 new electricians to get comfortable and familiar with the Protec workflow, while fixing electrical issues on lower levels in case wires malfunctioned or were misplaced. I was also asked to bring product, equipment, tools by our boss Brian Leopky up to the working electricians to improve work efficiency. In January of 2021, I decided I wanted to pursue a different career as I felt that this was not something I wanted to do for the rest of my life.</p>

            <p>After building my own Personal Computer in October 2020, I decided to look into what Programming/IT was all about so I decided to attend the <a href="https://www.bcit.ca/" target="_blank">Computer Information Technology</a> Program in September 2021 to learn everything there is to know about different computing technologies. Learning how to code, deploy applications, user interface, security, and much more. Finishing this program, I graduated with a 83% GPA in December 2023.</p>

            <p>After I got accepted into the Co-op Program before my 3rd Term in the Computer Information Technology Program. I went on a job search with the help of Susanna Kan, my Co-op Advisor. In October 2022, I received an internship offer from <a href="https://prospero.com/" target="_blank">CAMS Software</a> and started working as a Junior Developer in January 2023 for 8 months. During my time there, I learned how to code in a different language (C#), improved my knowledge in what I already knew (SQL) and demonstrated collaboration closely with 8 others in the team I was working with while diving into complex problems with effective solutions. Along what I was learning, I had created 10 manuals of documentation for any new developers that wanted to learn how to work with the legacy systems, and created a new tool with the new knowledge I obtained for over 15 clients. I also was able to solve over 40 tickets in time for continuous updates to the legacy system and learned how to communicate with 5 clients regarding any issues they had.</p>

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi there! I'm Zaafir Ali, but everyone calls me Zaaf. I am currently 23 years old, and here is some context about who I am. I was born and raised in New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada, and started playing soccer when I was 4 years old. My dad coached me and my friends until we were around 13 years old. Growing up, I loved playing soccer, but I also enjoyed watching it. I watched highlights of some of my favorite stars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar to try and play like them. I played various sports like basketball, badminton, and volleyball, but soccer was always my favorite.</p>
        <p>Apart from sports, I loved playing video games as it helped me escape reality and enjoy my free time. I spent my days after school and weekends constantly playing video games like Call of Duty, FIFA, and Minecraft with my school and online friends. Besides going to school daily, my parents enrolled me in Friday classes at a local Masjid to learn about Islam and how to read the Quran. Although I didn't take it seriously then, I am now grateful that my parents did. Learning about Islam and being a Muslim has helped me a lot, especially in where I am today. Because of that, I always helped the elderly during Ramadan at the Masjid by serving food, cleaning up, setting up tables, and more because I enjoyed helping anyone and everyone, especially the elderly.</p>
        <p>Around the age of 13, my dad helped me become a soccer referee to earn some money while I was in school. I started refereeing small-sided games and, once I was 16, began refereeing higher-level games, which helped me improve my communication and team-building skills while learning more from experienced referees. Around that time, I also spent a lot more time playing soccer for an academy and training for an Under-21 team, wanting to learn as much as I could. I was able to play all positions, but I always preferred playing on the left wing. I always wanted to play, no matter what position I had to play; I just always wanted to be on the field playing.</p>
        <p>After I graduated in 2019, I was still deciding what I wanted to do for a career. I was leaning towards the construction industry, considering a path in carpentry or electrical work, but after some experience, I felt that it was not the right career choice for me and my lifestyle. I wanted to be able to spend time with my family and do the things that I enjoy, but I felt I didn't have the time for that. I also wanted to challenge myself every day and try to learn something new all the time rather than just be stuck doing the same thing every day. Despite how much I loved playing soccer and being outdoors, I never stopped playing video games and always played them.</p>
        <p>In 2020, I decided to switch from console gaming to building my own personal computer for gaming, without knowing that I would enjoy learning about programming. About six months later, a family friend introduced me to a programming language called Python. From there, I became interested in learning all I could about computers, so I decided to enroll in a two-year program at the British Columbia Institute of Technology called Computer Information Technology. Within my first term, I struggled a lot, nearly dropping out and thinking that it wasn't for me. I always had a great interest in programming despite thinking that I was not fit for it, but I wanted to improve. I spent days and nights trying to improve my ability to think like a programmer so that I could be smart enough to develop applications on my own in the future and showcase any skills I have.</p>
        <p>After the second term, I was accepted into the Co-op Program, where I got the chance to experience an internship with the help of advisors from my school. I looked at many roles, but despite not having confidence in my programming ability, I wanted to apply for developer positions and step out of my comfort zone to see if I could be a developer. During the hunt for a developer position at the time, in the middle of my third term, I received an internship offer for a Junior Developer position at CAMS Software. Within my first couple of months at CAMS, I did not know what to expect and was learning a new programming language called C# while improving my knowledge in what I already knew. I was solving complex problems, debugging tricky issues, and learning a lot from many experienced developers while providing documentation for any new developers at CAMS. I was given a new and different challenge every day and enjoyed the team I was working with.</p>
        <p>Midway through my internship, I started dating this amazing girl I met through a mutual friend online. Natasha, my best friend to this day, whom I started dating on June 11th, 2023. She was from Kelowna, British Columbia, so we had a long-distance relationship for a while, seeing each other every second week because of how close we were to each other. Before we got to know each other more, I let her know that I wanted to live an Islamic life with a Muslim wife, and she was already interested in the idea of converting to Islam. Since then, both of us got closer to each other's families. After I finished my internship at CAMS in August 2023 and graduated from the Computer Information Technology Program in December 2023, Natasha and I got religiously married through Islam on January 28th, 2024, and she converted to Islam. From that day, I decided to move out of New Westminster to Kelowna to start the next chapter of my life with her. I continue to teach her about Islam and want to live the most successful life I can with her. Now, I'm currently hunting for a developer/engineer position or any position in the tech industry while working on personal projects and creating this portfolio.</p>
